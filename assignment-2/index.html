            <span>Shadows fall over my heart</span>
            <span>I blackout the moon</span>

            <span>You got me dancing in the dark</span>
            <span>(Dancing in the dark)</span>
            <span>I've closed my eyes</span>
            <span>But I won't sleep tonight</span>
            <span>Baby, you</span>
            <span>Should come with me</span>

            <span>With a blackout, blackout</span>
            <span>Hit the lights with a</span>
            <span>Blackout, blackout, woo</span>
